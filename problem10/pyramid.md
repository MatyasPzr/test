# Pyramid problem
- As you may remember we already solved this one. What I ask
you to do today is to solve it one more time.
- Your quest is to specify the size of pyramid in variable maybe
- And then generate a pyramid of size specified


# Example:
## size = 7
## Pyramid:

- ----#----
- ---###---
- --#####--
- -#######-
